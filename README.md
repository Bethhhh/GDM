# GDM: Growing Dual-Memory Self-Organizing Networks

Batch and incremental learning on the CORe50 dataset (50 instances, 10 categories).

Episodic Memory: Gamma-GWR with temporal synapses and intrinsic replay

Semantic Memory: Regulated Gamma-GWR (sample annotations used to regulate neurogenesis and neural update)

Standard Gamma-GWR (not needed to run this code): https://github.com/giparisi/neunets
